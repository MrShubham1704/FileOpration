## This Java program demonstrates essential file operations: writing, reading, and modifying text files. It creates or overwrites a file using `BufferedWriter`, reads and displays its contents with `BufferedReader`, and appends additional data without erasing existing content. The program is structured with separate methods for each operation (`writeToFile`, `readFromFile`, and `appendToFile`), ensuring modularity and ease of use. It handles exceptions to prevent runtime errors and ensures smooth execution. Running the program writes initial content, reads it, appends new text, and displays the modified content. This script is useful for handling text-based data storage in real-world applications.
